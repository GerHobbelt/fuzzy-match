But neither politicians nor scientists should be controlled by the interests of the powerful financial groups that have been harassing us constantly , here and in Brussels , for weeks .
The experts must work completely objectively and transparently , in a peaceful environment , and they must give us reliable and objective answers .
I will not hide from you that this week I received a very interesting report from the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study of Disorders of Bees , which is made up of eminent scientists .
That report officially records the presence of doses of substances I previously mentioned as having been found in pollen .
It has been reported to me that the firm Bayer itself , naming no names , was astonished by this new evidence .
To quote just one of these findings : the use of Gaucho for pelleting sunflower seed results in a significant risk for bees of different ages .
As with sunflower , the concentration ratio for the Gaucho pelleting of maize seed proves worrying given the consumption of pollen .
Having said that , Commissioner , there is an urgent need for action to establish the real causes of the worrying rate of mortality among bees .
In the meantime , our beekeepers need help , more funds to cope with this new crisis , whatever its origin .
I hope that the Commission will move this time , that it will take our demands seriously , that it will see that serious studies are made to get to the bottom of this crisis .
Meanwhile , as I said , we must take measures to prevent the disappearance of beekeepers with all the harmful ecological consequences that this would entail .
That is why , Commissioner , we are asking the Commission to kindly give a clear answer to the three specific questions we have put to you in the course of this debate .
Mr President , I have been well aware of your commitment to this subject for a long time , Mrs Lulling , and of your competence and strength of feeling .
In addressing me , you said these concerns were also felt in the country of which I am still a citizen .
I do also understand , from the words you used , your dissatisfaction and your expectations .
Nevertheless , that is a long way from saying that we are trying to sidestep the issue , that we are turning a deaf ear or that we have lost the plot .
So I am going to try and give a serious and lucid answer to your three questions .
However , the Commission wishes to stress that any such effect is already taken into account in the evaluation of insecticides required under the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market .
Member States are not allowed to authorise a plant protection product if it has an unacceptable effect on non-target organisms such as bees .
Moreover , an assessment of any possible effect of residues on public health is a prior condition for setting maximum levels of pesticide residues in food .
The Commission notes that most of the concerns expressed in this regard relate to two insecticides that are currently being evaluated , Mrs Lulling .
Regarding investigations into this subject , the directive does not require the studies to be conducted by the Commission itself .
On the other hand , the Commission is fully informed of the studies necessary in order to demonstrate the acceptability of particular substances .
It has been provided with information on the decline in bee populations in some Member States , as you yourself have solemnly emphasised .
At present , we are told , there is no scientific proof that this decline is due to a single factor such as pesticide use .
The Commission is also informed of research currently being undertaken by the Member States , by industry and by scientific associations under the watchful eye of the associations .
The Commission is itself following the matter very closely .
It will , of course , continue to monitor developments and will take appropriate measures in due course should that appear necessary .
The French programme , for example , included a study of the effects of plant protection products on bees .
The programmes for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 marketing years also provide aids for the reconstitution of bee stocks .
Those are the most definite and most precise answers I can give you on the three points raised in your oral question .
Mr President , Commissioner , we all know that Mrs Lulling is not only the European Parliament 's queen of wine but also its queen bee .
I should like to thank her very warmly for this commitment , because we should be aware that this has been a matter of concern to the European Parliament for decades .
Back in the 1980s , the Bavarian Member of Parliament and pan-European , Heinrich Aigner , who sadly is no longer with us , brought together hundreds of Bavarian beekeepers to inject some impetus into this issue .
We have been working on it for 30 years , and unfortunately we have not made a great deal of progress .
That is why I really believe that now is the time to promote something that is under serious threat , namely passing on beekeeping to the next generation .
I should particularly like to thank you , Commissioner , for your examples from France , which plays a leading role in this sector .
Your country also has a former agriculture minister for president and it is a country , which , thank God , takes healthy eating and delicious food very seriously .
Quite extraordinary problems of declining bee colonies have been observed in France for several years now , since 1995 to be precise .
It seems on investigation that this bee mortality is not the result of a conventional pathology .
Several other hypotheses have been examined , such as climate , general pollution or the incorrect use of plant protection products .
While these may sometimes carry some of the responsibility , however , they are far from accounting for the full scale of the disaster .
On this point I do not agree with the opinion you have just expressed , Commissioner .
The more observations are made , the more these findings are confirmed .
That is why , again at the instigation of Dominique Souchet and Astrid Lulling , the European Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture arranged a hearing on the subject on 28 April last .
Gaucho and Regent molecules could therefore be harmful not only to bees but to a much wider environment .
Let us not stop there , either .
Since these molecules are present in agricultural products used in food or animal feed , we should also be concerned about our own health .
That is why , faced with this risk of widespread poisoning of the ecosystem - and perhaps of man - we are insisting that the precautionary principle be applied .
I heard the Commission 's answers to Mr Souchet 's and Mrs Lulling 's oral question just now .
I believe it is taking too much of a wait-and-see attitude .
In our view , the precautionary principle means banning the use of the products in question , at least on all honey plants .
Measures should also be taken to compensate beekeepers and enable them to repopulate their hives .
Mr President , I will respond briefly to the few comments that have been made .
Contrary to what may have been said , the Commission takes very seriously this question that Mrs Lulling has vehemently and competently defended and that Mr Souchet put with her .
Work on the substances in question has been going on for several years .
The International Commission on Plant-Bee Relations , whose particular brief it is to examine the dangers threatening bees , has just held an international symposium in Bologna on the subject .
Its findings are that the deterioration in the health of bees and the reduced performance of colonies observed in a number of countries probably do not have such a simple , single cause .
You mentioned the ecosystem , Mr Berthu .
I would remind you that I have a longstanding commitment in this area .
As a former environment minister in my country , I am sensitive to this question .
The symposium agreed to form a working party to look into the deteriorating health of bees .
The working party will report to the next symposium , which will be held in 2005 .
I confirm that the Commission will be following this work closely and will draw a number of definite conclusions from it .
Mr Posselt , whom I thank for his opinion , regretted that fewer and fewer young people are taking up this wonderful rural occupation of beekeeping .
I simply want to confirm that national programmes concerning honey provide funding for technical assistance to encourage young people to become beekeepers and improve their results .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Mrs Lulling wishes to provide the sting in the tail .
Mr President , the Commissioner has said that the Commission has no scientific proof of the correlation between bee mortality and the use of new generation pesticides .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be on 9 October 2003 .
I should like to inform the House that Lord Bethell has informed me of his resignation , with effect from 30 September 2003 .
In accordance with Rule 8 ( 3 ) of the Rules of Procedure , the House takes note of this vacancy .
Mr President , I do not want to delay the House , but it would inappropriate if I did not mark that particular announcement on behalf of the whole House .
Lord Bethell has been a popular and hard-working Member of this House for very many years .
His service has been appreciated by all sides of the House .
We recall his work on human rights in the Soviet Union when it was at the height of its powers .
He brought the plights of Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov to widespread public attention .
This Parliament 's Sakharov Prize is something he played a key role in instituting .
He also had a direct role in air liberalisation , so he has had a direct effect upon consumers throughout the European Union .
I believe that every politician would hope to be in a position in which , in their lifetime , they could have made at least some difference on behalf of their constituents .
For the people of Europe , Lord Bethell can say that he has been a politician who has made a difference .
He will be greatly missed by all sides of the House .
I should also like to inform the House that Mrs Maij-Weggen has been appointed Royal Commissioner for North Brabant Province in the Netherlands .
She has informed me of her resignation with effect from 1 October 2003 .
I should like to congratulate her on her appointment .
In accordance with Rule 8 ( 3 ) of the Rules of Procedure , the House takes note of the vacancy .
I have been informed by the competent Slovak authorities that Jozef Heriban has been appointed as observer in place of Imrich Béres , with effect from 9 September 2003 .
The next item is the vote .
( Parliament adopted the text )
President .
That concludes the vote .
The von Wogau report therefore proposes regulating arms exports and making them more ethical .
One might as well try to make murder , plunder or abduction more ethical .
The simple fact that the great powers are wasting enormous sums of money on weapons of mass destruction shows that the present organisation of society is barbaric .
Even that , however , is proving impossible .
In an economy where arms dealers are willing to sell the rope to hang themselves if it makes them a profit , how can they be prevented from bypassing government controls ?
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament .
( The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m. )
